        "discription":"Ottoman Empire, empire created by Turkish tribes in Anatolia (Asia Minor) that grew to be one of the most powerful states in the world during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Ottoman period spanned more than 600 years and came to an end only in 1922, when it was replaced by the Turkish Republic and various successor states in southeastern Europe and the Middle East. At its height the empire encompassed most of southeastern Europe to the gates of Vienna, including present-day Hungary, the Balkan region, Greece, and parts of Ukraine; portions of the Middle East now occupied by Iraq, Syria, Israel, and Egypt; North Africa as far west as Algeria; and large parts of the Arabian Peninsula. The term Ottoman is a dynastic appellation derived from Osman I (Arabic: ʿUthmān), the nomadic Turkmen chief who founded both the dynasty and the empire about 1300."

        "discription":"In 1912, encouraged by the Russians, the Balkan states of Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro formed a Balkan alliance. Their key objective was to force the Ottoman Empire from the Balkans by taking Macedonia and dividing it up between themselves. The Ottoman Empire was already weakened by a war with Italy over Tripolitania the year before and was almost completely driven out of the Balkans in seven weeks. Austria was horrifi ed; it could not accept a strengthened Serbia. Austrian generals called for war. There was a danger, however, that Russia would support its ally, Serbia, and that events could spiral into a wider European war. "
